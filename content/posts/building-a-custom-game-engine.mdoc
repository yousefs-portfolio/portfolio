# Building a Custom Game Engine in Rust

Building a game engine from scratch is one of the most rewarding challenges in software engineering. It combines systems programming, graphics, physics, and creative problem-solving.

## Why Rust?

Rust provides the perfect balance of:
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and no garbage collector
- **Safety**: Memory safety without runtime overhead
- **Concurrency**: Fearless concurrency with the borrow checker

## Architecture Overview

The engine uses a custom Entity Component System (ECS) architecture:

```rust
pub struct World {
    entities: Vec<Entity>,
    components: ComponentStorage,
    systems: SystemScheduler,
}
```

## Rendering Pipeline

Using Vulkan for maximum control over the GPU:
- Custom render graph system
- Multi-threaded command buffer recording
- Efficient resource management

## Performance Considerations

- Data-oriented design for cache efficiency
- SIMD optimizations for math operations
- Job system for parallel execution

## Lessons Learned

Building a game engine teaches you about every layer of the computing stack, from CPU cache lines to GPU shader optimization.
